# Monte carlo integration

Uses Monte carlo integration example to integrate the function `exp(-u^2/2)/sqrt(2*pi)` from `u=-5` to `u=5`.
Two examples are given.  

* using_loops - Uses a for loop  
* vectorised - Vectorised solution


The vectorised version is much faster. One example run gave the following timings

* using loops - 53.585 seconds
* vectorised - 1.214 seconds

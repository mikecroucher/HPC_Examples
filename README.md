# HPC_Examples

A set of examples that demonstrates how to use a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster that uses a Sun Grid Engine (SGE) variant as the scheduler.

Originally designed to complement a short seminar given to a research group I work with at Sheffield. 

All examples work on the Sheffield Iceberg Cluster but could easily be adapted to many other systems.

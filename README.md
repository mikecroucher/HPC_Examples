# HPC_Examples

A set of examples that demonstrates how to use a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster that uses a Sun Grid Engine (SGE) variant as the scheduler.

All examples work on the Sheffield Iceberg cluster, https://github.com/rcgsheffield/iceberg_software,  but could easily be adapted to many other systems.
